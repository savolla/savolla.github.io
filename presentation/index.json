Doom and it\u0026rsquo;s packages are working together to make developer\u0026rsquo;s life easy. Here I made a complete list for you guys. This is a step by step guide to do coding on doom emacs. By the way when I say things like C-c C-p it means CTRL + c + p\nbefore we start to make things work enable specified modules in your init file\n do SPC f p and select init.el enable(uncomment) the following modules;  magit treemacs lookup   reload doom by doing SPC h r r  cloning projects  SPC g C to run magit clone press u to specify repo url paste your url with Ctrl Shift v (for linux) specify the path for the repo press y to make origin default branch wait until the cloning is finished press q to quit  adding projects  SPC o p to open treemacs C-c C-p a specify the path for your porject now you see your project directory appeared in your treemacs menu  navigate files  SPC SPC brings menu with all files under your project root type any keyword you want  you don\u0026rsquo;t have to type entire file name. menu items will be reduced once you type some characters.\nfind symbols (method, variable, objects)  press SPC / type your keyword or function, variable, class or struct names. once you enter the keyword, doom will jump to that file instantly C-o to go back C-i to go forward  recent files if you work on other things other than your project, for example editin some config files while coding etc, then you probably type the file path every single time to navigate to that config file. doom solves it with\n SPC f r brings a menu or recently visited files find and navigate C-o to go back C-i to go forward  lookup code sometimes we can\u0026rsquo;t find a good documentation on a method/module when coding. the best way to understand something is to looking at examples\n navigate your cursor on method, module you want to understand do SCP s o choose Github before hitting RET you can optionally specify the following items for more accurate results;  filename: path: extension:    here is an example for searching printf on github\n printf extension:.c filename:main.c path:src\n find and replace projectwise you can change a variable or method name projectwise. this is usefull in code refactoring. here is how to do that in doom;\n SPC / enter the symbol name. \u0026ldquo;emacs\u0026rdquo; in this example C-c C-e :%s/emacs/doom/g RET Z Z  there must be an easier way..\n","description":"","id":12,"section":"posts","tags":["tools","doom","emacs","programming","howto"],"title":"programming in doom emacs","uri":"https://savolla.github.io/posts/programming-in-doom-emacs/"},{"content":"Here I made some album recommendations for you. This is what i listen to when i really want to get into the mood. i made my best by separating genres into two categories. this list will grow up. I\u0026rsquo;ll trow goodies here when i think it\u0026rsquo;s worthy\nmusic for normies this is normal music for normal people\n Tokyo Rose - Chases 2\ngreat synthwave album.. my favorite song on this is midnight chase Dance with the Dead - Loved to Death\nsynthwave + some metal elements. great if you like distortion guitar riffs. this one includes awesome guitar solos. and the production is just incredible ALIX 2084 (EP)\ndirectly jump to Elevator Dance Party song. great work and really underrated. those tempo changes will shake your brain inside Mega Drive - Hardwired V1.4\nDataline Dataline Dataline !!
