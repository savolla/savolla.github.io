In this video, we\u0026rsquo;ll be building a complete CI/CD pipeline from the ground up. I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through setting up and using a variety of powerful tools including Terraform, Proxmox, NixOS, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes, and many more.\n[Display additional tools on screen.]\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating this pipeline from scratch, beginning with Infrastructure as Code. Using Terraform and Proxmox, we‚Äôll spin up our servers, then proceed to install essential tools such as Jenkins, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, SonarQube, Nexus, and monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a sample application using the full pipeline.\nThis will be a multi-part tutorial series, so stay tuned for more!\nPipeline Showcase # This is the pipeline we\u0026rsquo;ll be building throughout this tutorial series. I\u0026rsquo;ve intentionally made it complex to maximize the learning experience. Throughout the setup, I‚Äôve gained a lot of valuable insights, and now, I‚Äôm excited to share that knowledge with you. My goal is to help you deepen your understanding and take your skills to the next level.\n[start explaining pipeline from start to finish]\nA Note For My Environment # Let me quickly explain my environment so you‚Äôre comfortable following along.\nFor this tutorial, I‚Äôll be using a special Linux distribution called NixOS. The reason I chose NixOS is because of its powerful package manager and overall stability. I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through how to install packages and use some of its key features. However, if you prefer using another Linux distro like Arch or Debian, that‚Äôs perfectly fine. It won‚Äôt make a big difference. But If you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows or macOS, I won‚Äôt be covering the installation of tools on those systems, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to handle that part on your own.\nFor my text editor, I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Emacs, but feel free to use VSCode or any other tool you‚Äôre comfortable with.\nTo manage my terminal sessions more efficiently, I‚Äôll be using tmux. It\u0026rsquo;s an essential tool for anyone who spends a lot of time in the terminal, as it allows you to manage multiple sessions within a single terminal window. Plus, it preserves your SSH connections even if you accidentally close the terminal. For this tutorial, I‚Äôll be using two tmux sessions: one for editing text and typing commands in Emacs, and another for managing SSH connections. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll explain everything as we go to make it all crystal clear.\nTo help you follow along more easily, I‚Äôll also be running a tool called screenkey, which will display my keystrokes in the bottom right corner.\nCode and Documentation # I want to make things as easy as possible for you. All the code and documentation from this series will be available in one place. Just head over to savolla.github.io/cortex, where you‚Äôll find my personal knowledge base. Click on the ‚ÄòVideos‚Äô section, find the video you‚Äôre watching, and you‚Äôll have access to all the code and resources.\nIn the next episode, we‚Äôll begin by installing Proxmox as a virtual machine and use Terraform to spin up our servers\n","date":"2025-09-02","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/zero-to-hero-cicd-pipeline-part1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Zero to Hero CICD Pipeline | Part 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2025-09-01","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/emacs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Emacs","type":"tags"},{"content":" Basic Customizations # Header # ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- Dashboard # Nothing is better than a clean and customized dashboard.
