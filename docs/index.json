In this video, we\u0026rsquo;ll be building a complete CI/CD pipeline from the ground up. I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through setting up and using a variety of powerful tools including Terraform, Proxmox, NixOS, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Kubernetes, and many more.\n[Display additional tools on screen.]\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating this pipeline from scratch, beginning with Infrastructure as Code. Using Terraform and Proxmox, we’ll spin up our servers, then proceed to install essential tools such as Jenkins, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, SonarQube, Nexus, and monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a sample application using the full pipeline.\nThis will be a multi-part tutorial series, so stay tuned for more!\nPipeline Showcase # This is the pipeline we\u0026rsquo;ll be building throughout this tutorial series. I\u0026rsquo;ve intentionally made it complex to maximize the learning experience. Throughout the setup, I’ve gained a lot of valuable insights, and now, I’m excited to share that knowledge with you. My goal is to help you deepen your understanding and take your skills to the next level.\n[start explaining pipeline from start to finish]\nA Note For My Environment # Let me quickly explain my environment so you’re comfortable following along.\nFor this tutorial, I’ll be using a special Linux distribution called NixOS. The reason I chose NixOS is because of its powerful package manager and overall stability. I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through how to install packages and use some of its key features. However, if you prefer using another Linux distro like Arch or Debian, that’s perfectly fine. It won’t make a big difference. But If you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows or macOS, I won’t be covering the installation of tools on those systems, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to handle that part on your own.\nFor my text editor, I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Emacs, but feel free to use VSCode or any other tool you’re comfortable with.\nTo manage my terminal sessions more efficiently, I’ll be using tmux. It\u0026rsquo;s an essential tool for anyone who spends a lot of time in the terminal, as it allows you to manage multiple sessions within a single terminal window. Plus, it preserves your SSH connections even if you accidentally close the terminal. For this tutorial, I’ll be using two tmux sessions: one for editing text and typing commands in Emacs, and another for managing SSH connections. Don’t worry, I’ll explain everything as we go to make it all crystal clear.\nTo help you follow along more easily, I’ll also be running a tool called screenkey, which will display my keystrokes in the bottom right corner.\nCode and Documentation # I want to make things as easy as possible for you. All the code and documentation from this series will be available in one place. Just head over to savolla.github.io/cortex, where you’ll find my personal knowledge base. Click on the ‘Videos’ section, find the video you’re watching, and you’ll have access to all the code and resources.\nIn the next episode, we’ll begin by installing Proxmox as a virtual machine and use Terraform to spin up our servers\n","date":"2025-09-02","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/zero-to-hero-cicd-pipeline-part1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Zero to Hero CICD Pipeline | Part 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2025-09-01","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/emacs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Emacs","type":"tags"},{"content":" Basic Customizations # Header # ;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*- Dashboard # Nothing is better than a clean and customized dashboard.

But I also heavily configured it to my likings. When I toggle vter buffer it also reads the current workspace name and opens a tmux session with the same name. This is quite handy because I can manage my terminals based on workspace and projects. For example I use projectile package for project management. And when I open a new project it opens it in a separate workspace with project name. So when I open vterm it also automatically creates a new tmux session with project\u0026rsquo;s name.\nSetup some environment for vterm first.

This causes vterm to warn me about the running process when I try to exit from it.

Only the 0.14.8 version of the tailwind server works correctly (speaking for 2025) And the last option is from a GitHub issue that I found back in the day. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember which one.. you also need to do some adjustments in packages.el file.\n","date":"2025-09-01","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-literate-doom-emacs-config/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My Literate Doom Emacs Config","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
