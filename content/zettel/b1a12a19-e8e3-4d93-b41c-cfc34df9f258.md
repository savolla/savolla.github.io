-   you'll need to create an org mode source block for this
-   here is the example source block that prints all org roam notes with tags `orgmode` and `emacs`
    ```org
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value raw
      (mapconcat
       (lambda (node)
         (format "- [[id:%s][%s]]"
                 (org-roam-node-id node)
                 (org-roam-node-title node)))
       (org-roam-ql-nodes
        '(tags "emacs" "orgmode"))
       "\n")
      #+end_src
    ```
-   when you execute this block using `org-babel-execute-src-block` you'll get a list of results
-   you can also see [get list of org roam notes with specific tags (OR operator)]({{< relref "e58643fc-c890-4c5e-ad8a-d325ea056f15" >}})
