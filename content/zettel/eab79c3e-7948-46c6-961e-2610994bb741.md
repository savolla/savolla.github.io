Enable the “Docker Bearer Token Realm” in Nexus
If this is not enabled, Nexus won't accept Docker login requests.
In the Nexus UI:
Go to Security → Realms
On the right side (Available realms), find:
Docker Bearer Token Realm
Move it to the left (Active realms) using the &gt; button
Make sure it is above the Docker Token realm if both are active
Click Save
