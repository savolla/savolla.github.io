you can install multiple versions of wine on your system. I provided those options below. usually you only need `wineWowPackages.staging`

```nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # ...

    # support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications
    wineWowPackages.stable

    # support 32-bit only
    wine

    # support 64-bit only
    (wine.override { wineBuild = "wine64"; })

    # support 64-bit only
    wine64

    # wine-staging (version with experimental features)
    wineWowPackages.staging

    # winetricks (all versions)
    winetricks

    # native wayland support (unstable)
    wineWowPackages.waylandFull
  ];
}
```
