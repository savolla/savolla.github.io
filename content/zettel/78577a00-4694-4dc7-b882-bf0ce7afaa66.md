-   by **port forwarding**
    ```shell
      oc get services
      # check your service's PORT number (say it's 80)
      # say your service name is jenkins
      oc port-forward svc/jenkins 3000:80
    ```
    notice that port `3000` is the port on your host machine and port `80` is that jenkins exposes
